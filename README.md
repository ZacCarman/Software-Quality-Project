### IndexCollect
This function takes in an integer array of any size and an integer value. The function will return and integer arraylist of all indexes the entered value appears in the given array.
Testing:
Testing of this function includes testing for both correctness and timeout conditions. This test case involves passing through assigned variables and increasing amount of random variables for timeout conditions.

### MIN
This function takes in an integer array of any size and returns an integer. This integer will hold the value of the minimum value from the array.
Testing:
Testing of this function includes testing for both correctness and timeout conditions. This test case simply passes through expected values.

### MAX
This function takes in an integer array of any size and returns an integer. This integer will hold the value of the maximum value from the array.
Testing:
Testing of this function includes testing for both correctness and timeout conditions. This test case simply passes through expected values.

### shuffle
This function takes in an integer array of an size and returns the array. The array will be returned shuffled using a Fisherâ€“Yates shuffle.
Testing:
Testing of this function includes testing for both correctness and timeout conditions. This test case involves passing through assigned variables and increasing amount of random variables for timeout conditions.

### NewRandom
This function takes in an integer and returns a long value. The entered integer is used as a range to generate the random value. When the function is called a key is set for the object so every consecutive call of the random function will have the same key.
Testing:
Testing of this function includes testing for both correctness and timeout conditions. As well as testing to make sure random can generate all values within the range.

### RockPaperScissors
This function will take in a string value and return a boolean value. The string value passed is the users selection and must equal "rock", "paper", or "scissors". The boolean value passed back is whether the user won or lose(Tie will return false).
Testing:
Testing of this function includes testing for both correctness and timeout conditions. This test case simply passes through expected values.

### EuclideanDistance
This function takes in 4 double values representing x1,y1,x2,y2 and returns a double value. The returned value will be the distance between the coordinates passed through the function.
Testing:
Testing of this function includes testing for both correctness and timeout conditions. This test case simply passes through expected values.

### BubbleSortASC and BubbleSortDES
These two functions take in an integer array and returns the array sorted. These functions use bubble sort to return the sorted array. BubbleSortASC returns the array sorted in ascending order and BubbleSortDES return the array sorted in descending order.
Testing:
Testing of this function includes testing for both correctness and timeout conditions. This test case involves passing through assigned variables and increasing amount of random variables for timeout conditions.

### InsertionSortASC and InsertionSortDES
These two functions take in an integer array and returns the array sorted. These functions use insertion sort to return the sorted array. InsertionSortASC returns the array sorted in ascending order and InsertionSortDES returns the array sorted in descending order.
Testing:
Testing of this function includes testing for both correctness and timeout conditions. This test case involves passing through assigned variables and increasing amount of random variables for timeout conditions.

# Deliverables:

- (2 Marks) A one-page proposal on project description and plan needs to be submitted in
Blackboard by February 10.
- (3 Marks) A progress report with the snapshots of preliminary experiments need to be
submitted by March 9. At this stage the project can be changed upon providing explanations
with results why the initial choice on project was not right. The reasons need to be properly
justified in the report.
- (5 Marks) Group presentations will take place on April 5 and April 8 lecture time. The schedule
will be posted closer to these dates. Presentation should contain discussion on:
1. Test cases or methods
2. Test data
3. Statistics on bugs (if any) or improvements (if any) because of using test cases or test data
- (10 Marks) Submission of a zip file in Canvas must contain the following:
1. Presentation slides
2. Source code, test cases, and test data with proper documentation
3. A final project report explaining the details of the project, design choices, implementation
challenges, and lessons learned
The deadline for submitting the report in blackboard is April 9, 2021 11.59pm
